# BankID API

This little module helps with BankID integrations.

## Authentication flow

![BankID Authentication flow](auth_flow.png)

Example in the `./example/` directory demonstrates using the BankID app on another device.

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
    "time"

    "github.com/jfernstad/bankid"
)

func main() {

    // Let's use the official messages
    // for events and errors, in English
    p, _ := bankid.NewMessages("en")

    caTestPath := "../CA/test.crt"
    rpCrtPath := "../rp/bankid_rp_test.crt" // NOTE: Replace with your RP (Relaying Partner) certificate
    rpKeyPath := "../rp/bankid_rp_test.key" // NOTE: Replace with your RP key

    // bankid.TestBaseURL or bankid.ProductionBaseURL
    env, err := bankid.NewEnvironment(bankid.TestBaseURL, caTestPath, rpCrtPath, rpKeyPath)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf(" !! Could not create TestEnvironment: %s", err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Remove non-digits from personal number
    personalNumber := "198001010109" // NOTE: Replace with a real personal number
    ipAddr := "127.0.0.1"            // IP of your mobile phone with BankID app on it

    // Print message as instructed by the RP Guidelines v3.2.2
    fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA19))

    rsp, err := bankid.Auth(env, personalNumber, ipAddr)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf(" !! Could not connect to server: %s\n", err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Auth started!
    // Pull out your BankID app and sign the Auth request
    collectResponse := &bankid.CollectResponse{}
    done := false
    for !done {
        collectResponse, err = bankid.Collect(env, rsp.OrderRef)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf(" !! Could not collect: %s\n", err.Error())
            os.Exit(1)
        }

        switch collectResponse.Status {
        case bankid.OrderPending:
            switch collectResponse.HintCode {
            case bankid.PendOutstandingTransaction:
                {
                    fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA1))
                }
            case bankid.PendNoClient:
                {
                    fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA1))
                }
            case bankid.PendStarted:
                {
                    fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA14_B))
                }
            case bankid.PendUserSign:
                {
                    fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA9))
                }
            }
        case bankid.OrderFailed:
            {
                done = true
                switch collectResponse.HintCode {
                case bankid.FailCancelled:
                    {
                        fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA3))
                        break
                    }
                case bankid.FailUserCancel:
                    {
                        fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA6))
                        break
                    }
                case bankid.FailExpiredTransaction:
                    {
                        fmt.Println(" >> " + p.Msg(bankid.RFA8))
                        break
                    }
                }
            }
        case bankid.OrderComplete:
            {
                done = true
                log.Println(" >> ðŸ˜Ž Auth Complete ")
                log.Printf(" >> %s signed in!\n", collectResponse.CompletionData.User.Name)
                break
            }
        }
        // Don't spam the service plz
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    }

    // Just to demonstrate cancelling, we'll probably never end up here.
    if collectResponse.Status == bankid.OrderPending {
        err = bankid.Cancel(env, rsp.OrderRef)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf(" !! Could not cancel request: %s\n", err.Error())
        }
        log.Printf(" >> Auth cancelled\n")
    }
}

```

For signing data, use the `bankid.Sign()` method instead of the `bankid.Auth()` method. The flow is the same.
